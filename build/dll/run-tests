# Run the unit tests in containers with the shipping dependencies.
#
# This script is just a reminder that the easiest and most foolproof way to run
# the tests is to run them in containers. The tests are run this way as part of
# the build.
#
# Of course, this is not a fast way to run the tests.
#
# If you're doing significant development, and you want to run the tests
# quickly, you'll want to edit the code and run the tests in the same
# environment, which probably means creating a virtualenv with the appropriate
# dependencies. However, for a number of reasons, this is often not as easy as
# it sounds.
#
# Some of the difficulties are:
# - Python extensions that have significant build dependencies of their own
# - incompatibilities between versions of pip, setuptools, and
#   individual libraries.
